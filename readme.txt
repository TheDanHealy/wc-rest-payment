WC REST Payment adds in the missing REST API endpoint for **processing payment** in `WooCommerce`. 
 
== Description ==

If you are a front end developer, looking to develop an app/web with WordPress+WooCommerce as your backend using REST API. You will find that [WooCommerce docs does](http://woocommerce.github.io/woocommerce-rest-api-docs/) not provide the **process payment** endpoint. 

WC REST Payment adds in the missing REST API endpoint for **process payment** in `WooCommerce`. 
 
**IMPORTANT NOTICE:**

After payment is processed successfully, the `status` of `order` will be automatically changed to **Completed**. 
If you with to the status to be set to status other than **Complete** after successful payment process, please submit a pull request.
